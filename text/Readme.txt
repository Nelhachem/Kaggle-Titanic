File Description:
train.csv is the training data containing 28 X 28 gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits.
test.csv is the corresponding test data. And there is no label contained in the file.

The other two csv files are benchmark submissions. We also have the two R scripts that produce the benchmark.

Plan:
1. Make sure you know how to use the benchmark script to produce the same result.
2. Maybe it is a good time implement what you write in the machine learning guideline.
